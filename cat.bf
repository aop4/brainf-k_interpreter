[ This program is borrowed from the Esolang page for Brainfuck:
  https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Cat
  You may need to use a different implementation listed there, depending on how
  EOF is represented in your system.
  Usage: ./run cat.bf < your_file_name (use file as input stream)
  Alternatively: ./run cat.bf (this will copy all user input to the screen)
